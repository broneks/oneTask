		<p>There's no need for task lists... Just do one thing, and do it for yourself. Set a task and complete it before time runs out.</p>

		<p>If you complete the task in time, then good for you! You can check off that it's completed (be honest!) and you will receive a special celebration at random. If you don't manage to complete the task before the timer runs out, then come on... you had <em>one</em> job!! You'll have to reset it and try again.</p>

		<p>Feel free to close the app and come back to it later in the same browser. The timer for your last task will keep running!</p>

		<p>Have fun!</p>
